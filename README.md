# Wyvern of Marina
Proprietary Discord bot for the server called "The Marina" written in Discord.py. While the code may be open-source, **it is NOT intended for distribution or reproduction!** The open-source nature is for people in the server to see the inner workings of the bot and join in on the coding if they so choose.
