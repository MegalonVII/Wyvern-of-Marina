Ugh! How did you two even become friends in the first place?
You two are just better off as friends...
Don't ruin your friendship over this...
Take it easy now...
Something might be sparking...
I could potentially see it happening.
Maybe it could work!
You two should try going out on casual dates!
Give it a shot!
It's a match made in Heaven!
I don't think it's possible to create a better pairing!
